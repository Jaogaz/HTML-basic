    <h1>
      MANIFESTO
    </h1>

      <p>
        For this project I made a manifesto based on what design meant to me. I was instructed to
        type out my manifesto then display it in way that helps convey the message. I was asked to think
        about what design meant to me which was really a struggle being that I am a new designer but I thought
        about it and for me design meant using my abilities to change how we percive the world and inspire
        togetherness. I designed the statement using red to symbolize power and the white to symbolize peace.
        For the display I used paper to create a stand made of hands. Tha hands come together to form a strong base.
        You can read the entire statement at the bottom of the page.

          "I am a graphic designer. I have been given a given a gift that allows me to influence the world around me.
          I have been taught how color can attract or repel. How type can be used for practicality or decoration. I
          have also learned how graphics and photography can create different meaning and emotion depending on how they
          are created or used.
            Even though I have these gifts my profession is seen as unnecessary. It is damaged by the poor work of
            uneducated designers. It is the belief of the world that graphic designers are only good for labels and ads
            but our workgoes much deeper than that. Our work can be used to bring awareness to the injustices of the world.
            To inspire change in people and to bring the world together. That's what drives me every day as a designer
            and what I believe design is.

            My work is inspired by my life and how I was raised. I am from Antioch, Tennessee a small low-income community
            just south of Nashville where the graduation rate is low and most dont make it to college. I am the youngest of
            two to a single mother whose hard work and dedication inspired me to earn everything have in life. Growing up
            I have watched as the world has become seperated and self-centered and this is what I want my work to focus on.
              I want to change the thoughts of people so that they see a person in need and go and help instead of pass by
              with out a secong thought. I want to influence them to be open to new possibilities and trust in the power
              of themsleves and those around them. I feel that it is my duty as a designer to use my work to make these changes.
              So I'll ask, if you had the ability to change the world, wouldn't you?"
