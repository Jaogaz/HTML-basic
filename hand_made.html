    <h1>
      HAND MADE BOOKS
    </h1>

    <p>
      My talents are limited to only design and web work, I am also very good with my hands. These
      books are from a book making class. I wanted to make some sketch books for my own personal use.
      I created a collection of them using bookboard, cloth, glue, and string coated with wax. My idea
      was to make the books look worn and tathered so that they have some character. I was very proud
      of how these came out. You can check them out below.
