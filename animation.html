    <h1>
      IMMIGRATION ANIMATION
    </h1>

    <p>
      Immigration has been one of the most talked about problems in the United States today as well as in
      other countries. As a project I was instructed to pick a problem in the world and create a short animated video about it.
      I chose to cover immigration particularly Mexicans immigrating to the United States. My objective was to create a video
      that was intense and direct. I wanted it to not just be an animation but an eye opener. Though the animation is
      crude its message is still felt. I used a desert scene to show the land that they must travel to and a quite and
      ominus desert wind to create a painful and erie background noise. This video is my best animation to date so enjoy
      and think of those who have less but strive to gain more.
