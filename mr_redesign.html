    <h1>
      MORGANTOWN RUNNING WEBSITE REDSIGN
    </h1>

    <p>
      This was one of the first real website design projects for me. Morgantown Running is a shoe and apperal store,
      specifically for running. Their website really needed some work so as a project I was instructed to redsign
      the website using all of their content. I started with an IA diagram and then had some people put together a
      content map based on where they thought certain items belonged on the site. Once that was done I created mockups
      and tested them using inVision. I finished the site and uploaded it to a user testing site to get some feedback
      from individuals from around the United States. You can check out both the Morgantown Running website and my
      redesign of the site below.

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://morgantownrunning.com/">morgantownrunning.com</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="">my redesign</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I decided to completely redo their color scheme to a charging green that added excitment on top of
        a powerful black background. That was the biggest change I also gave their product page a new look by 
        adding an intro screen to their products and added and actual product screen so you can see the shoes.
        Thier old product screen was lacking interest and needed a new look. I also added in an online form to fill out
        for their club and a contact form for direct questions. Overall I was pleased with how this project turned
        out being that it was my first real attempt at creating a website.
