    <h1>
      CTE PUBLICATION
    </h1>

    <p>
      This project was a publication based project focused on learning how to design a layout
      for a publication of our own choosing. We were asked to design a cover, a table of contents
      for our departments page and our feature article along with the departments spread and article
      spread. I decided to make my publication about CTE (Chronic Traumatic Encephalopathy). CTE is caused
      by repetitive blows to the head which cause the brain to bruise as it rattles within the skull.
      While the immediate symptoms are usually concussions the long-term side effects include dementia, paranoia,
      alzhymers, memory loss and many more. The final outcome is normally death. CTE has become a rising problem in the NFL.
      In recent studies CTE was found withtin 90% of the brains examined by doctors from former NFL players. Some
      of the most notable deaths include San Deigo Charger Junior Seau, Pittsburgh Steeler Mike Webster, Oakland
      Raider Ken Stabler and many more and the number continues to grow. My publication was meant to be a memorial to these
      great players that gave their life for the game they loved and to help spread awareness of the sacrifice that playing
      football requires. Until the game changes CTE will always be apart of it. Check out the rest of the publication titled
      "Helmet to Helmet".

      For my departments page I wanted to open up with a memorial for some of the players that were confirmed
      to have CTE then I followed that with the science behind CTE how it works and some natural side-effects to look for.
      I also added some stories on how the NFL is changing it's rules and how teams are changing their training to help combat CTE.
      I followed that with a graphic about the best testing helmets. My feature article was about former Tennessee Titan
      Frank Wycheck. He claims to be suffering from CTE after being retired from the league for several years. The
      opening for the the feature article (Image at the top of the page) was meant to represent the pain, stress, and confusion that CTE can cause. I then
      created the article that just focuses on his story. I was very proud of this project and how well it turned out.
      CTE is a real problem that if is left unsolved will bring and end to the NFL. Please research this topic and
      learn how we can help end it.
