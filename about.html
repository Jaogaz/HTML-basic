      ABOUT ME
    </h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to my site! My name is Jason Ogaz I am 22 years old and I was born in Nashville, TN.
      My love of art started when I was a young kid in elementary school, I would always get into trouble for
      drawing when I should've been studying. It grew when one of my drawings as a kid got hung up in the local
      post office with some other drawings from kids in other shcools. I continued to draw growing up and even
      got so good other kids in my class would ask me to draw them a picture, usually a car with lamborghini doors
      as that was my specialty in middle school. In highschool I perfected my drawings doing things I had never done
      before and being pushed by my teacher because I was the first freshman he ever gave an "A" to. I am now a Graphic Design
      student at West Virginia University. I am learning how to create books, posters, logos, responsive websites, and products
      built to solve a problem. My mind is open and my goals have been set high. Ultimately I want to design videogames
      and create concept art for movies. I've got a long road ahead.
